The third edition of the Python in Astronomy Conference will be held at the
Lorentz Center on the **8 - 12th May 2017**.

As with the two previous Python in Astronomy conferences we aim to bring a wide
variety of people who use, develop or teach people about Python packages in the
context of all forms of Astronomy. The conference will include presentations,
tutorials unconference sessions and sprints. As well as building the community
around astronomical uses of Python the conference aims to improve collaboration
and interoperability between Python packages, share knowledge on Python packages
and techniques and provide training and educational materials for users and
developers of Python packages.
